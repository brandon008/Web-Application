<h2>Final Project: Voice Memo Organizer</h2>

I aim to create a voice memo organizer with the ability to create comments underneath. The point of this project is to be able to label and organize memos into Posts regarding their content. 

The user should only be able to post when logged in. Otherwise they may browse. If a User wishes, they may regester for access to post audio recordings and access discussion forumn. If I can figure it out I want to put an equalizer/visualizer to compliment the audio recording.
